This projects shows the code knowledge from the 
Master Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development(MCU1) course.

You can find it on UDEMY:

You could use the code! but after you should have MCU based on STM32L476xx.
And I recommend for beginers:

- Buy a development board based on STM32L4 like Nucleo Board or Discovery Board.
- Use STM32 Cube IDE and STM32 Cube Programer.
- And get the UDEMY course of course!
